## About

One day I got tired of performing duck-type validation as I shared entity-data across different endpoints of my beloved
JavaScript ecosystem. This library is initially inspired in [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)'s validation syntax. 

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @devtin/schema-validator
# or
$ yarn add @devtin/schema-validator
```

## At-a-glance

```js
{{{ sandbox }}}
```


## Further reading

I would suggest having a look at the [guide](./guide/README.md) and the [documentation](./DOCS.md) respectively.  
Maybe also playing with this <a href="https://codepen.io/tin_r/pen/VwYbego" target="_blank">codepen</a> for a quick overview.
